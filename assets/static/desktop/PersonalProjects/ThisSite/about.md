# Windows 95'd theme website
This website was born out of
* Wanting to learn more pheonix, specifically pheonix live view
* Wanting a unique personal website to showcase some of my work
* Deep nostalgia for my first real desktop... Windows 95
So I hatched this bizarre idea. I hope you enjoy it.  You can rearange the windows and open various directories and files.
