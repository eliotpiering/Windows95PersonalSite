This was a fun project that served as a way to try out Pheonix Live View

Its a Personal Website that hosts info about some of my projects, music, and general info. Instead of a boring canned website, I wanted to present this infomation in a unique way.  Also I was feeling a bit nostalgic.

Its stil a WIP, so be kind...
